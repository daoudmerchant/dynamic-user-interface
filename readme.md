# Brief

I've decided to make a project out of the Odin Project exercise adding dynamic user interface interactions for the following reasons:

- I want it to be accessible online to whomever might wish to see it
- As mentioned at the end of the last exercise, I need to improve my git commit frequency

## Thoughts before beginning

I will try and put the three exercises in to one webpage, that is to say:

- A dynamic dropdown menu at desktop size
- A menu sliding in from the side at mobile size
- Some sort of photo carousel

I also want the JS functions to be as reusable as possible, in the hope that they may come in handy for future projects.
